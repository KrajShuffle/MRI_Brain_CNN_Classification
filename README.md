# MRI_Brain_CNN_Classification

Developed a convolutional neural network for detecting the presence of a brain tumor and subsequently classifying its location from 5712 brain MRI images. Using open-cv, the images were resized to the MRI Brain scan region of interest (ROI) prior to resizing the image to (256,256). 5712 images from 4 distinct classes were used to train the network and the network was tested on 1311 images.
